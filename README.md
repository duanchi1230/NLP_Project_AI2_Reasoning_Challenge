# NLP_Project_AI2_Reasoning_Challenge ( Currently Under Development)
## Branches (undervelopment)
Current there are five branches corresponging to our five group members. Each branch will contain codes, papers to read and other materials.

## Dataset Description
The data set could found [Allen Institute for AI ARC](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/arc/submissions/public). The dataset contains 7,787 natural grade-school level multiple-choice SCIENCE questions. This dataset's level of difficulty requires far more powerful knowledge and reasoning capability than ever before datasets such SQuAD or SNLI. The data set has two partitions: EASY Set and CHALLENGE Set. And inside each set, it is also devided into train, test and development sets. A corpus is also given in the dataset which could be used as background inforamtion source. But the ARC challenge is not limited to this corpus knowledge and it could also be open book.

<b> Easy: </b>  
Easy-Train Set: 2251 questions  
Easy-Test Set: 2376 questions  
Easy-Development Set: 570 questions  

<b> Challenge: </b>  
The Challenge Set contains only questions answer incorrectly by both a retrieval-based algorithm and a word co-occurence algorithm.  

Challenge-Train Set: 1119 questions  
Challenge-Test Set: 1172 questions  
Challenge-Development Set: 299 questions
